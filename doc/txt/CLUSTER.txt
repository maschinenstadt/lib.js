reason for this: i want to use all the cpu cores AND NETWORK RESSOURCES parallel (that's
one reason why i've implemented SYNC functions before ASYNC versions)...



?> should i create some (local-/remote-)IPC communication protocol?



that was an answer to many things in controlling/managing all the events/processes;
.. and would be some more virtuality! .. (so maybe to combine with step-by-step extending
codes to ("own"..) scripting (parse/render, .. @ object/node w/ own console(s) (streams)..



=> PLUS: using NETWORK RESOURCES would be solved by this, too!! ...
