// this "TODO" array is meant for managing own TODO tasks in the objects ..
// ..
// e.g. if an sub-object is not yet available, but it will be in the future
// AND there's a task which is just partially done yet (as the missing obj.
// should be a part of this current task), .. we can "promise" (*g*) it for
// later ..
//
// we should let this automatically work, so we need more code w/ structure
